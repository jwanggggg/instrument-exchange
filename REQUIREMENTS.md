## End-User Observations

### Imaginary Personas

### Daniel Lee
Location: New York, NY

Biography: Daniel is a working guitarist located in New York City. He is looking to upgrade
his electric guitar to a very specific Stratocaster for a sharper sound. He has read online
that this guitar is perfect for the genre of music that he plays, but he can’t be sure until
he tries the guitar for himself. However, because he is a musician he does not have much
disposable income and he cannot afford to simply splurge on this pricey guitar, and local
guitar stores don’t have the model in stock. Instrument Exchange is perfect for Daniel
because he can rent out the model for a few days and try it at a few shows before deciding if it’s worth buying.

### Jessica Walton
Location: Nashville, TN

Biography: Jessica is an aspiring studio owner working in Nashville. Her studio has a lot of
high-end equipment including high-quality microphones and acoustic guitars. Since there are a lot of
aspiring singer-songwriters in Nashville, she wants to advertise to these musicians that they can use
the equipment in her studio for a low price to record or rehearse. Using Instrument Exchange, 
local studio owners like Jessica can list their inventory of equipment, recording rates, and available spaces. 
Musicians can browse Instrument Exchange to find spaces that they can afford and that have the equipment they need in stock.

### Joseph Kim
Location: San Jose, CA

Biography: Joseph runs a podcast about education that is quickly rising in popularity.
His discussion has garnered a lot of attention, and he now wants to upgrade microphones
for both himself and his co-hosts. He’s heard Shure and Neumann both make great 
microphones, but he doesn’t know which would be better for his show until he tries 
them both. Joseph could use Instrument Exchange to rent both brands of microphones 
for a period, record podcasts with both and then receive feedback from his audience 
about which one is better without needing to invest a full $3000 in a microphone he may not even like.

### Real life end-users

### Megan S.
Megan, a friend of Jonathan, plays piano for her NYU religious fellowship on a cheap keyboard. This year, the club has accumulated enough funds to invest in a good-quality instrument, and have let Megan decide what instrument she wants to buy. Megan decided to look at some online reviews for keyboards before buying one she thought was good, but unfortunately, the keyboard lacked velocity control, sounded tacky, and its tone was bright and garish, making it unsuitable for soft worship music. If Megan had a service like Instrument Exchange, she could have rented it off of a local seller in NY, tried it for a few gigs, then returned it when she realized it was not a good fit for her style and needs. Instead, she ended up wasting her fellowship's money and ending up unhappy with the instrument she bought.

### Timothy H.
Timothy, one of Jonathan's classmates, is an aspiring music producer who likes experimenting with different sounds and samples in his music. He has wanted to incorporate some unique, unconventional instruments into his music like the ukulele and the Chinese erhu, but as these instruments are quite niche, none of his friends own them. Additionally, he does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on an instrument that he potentially would only use once, and digital music samples of these instruments are not only expensive but also sound unrealistic. Instrument Exchange would be the perfect solution for Timothy, who could rent an instrument for a few days and record audio samples using them before deciding if he wants to purcahse the instrument from the seller or return it.
