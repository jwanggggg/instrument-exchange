<h2>Project Details</h2>  

<h3>History</h3>  
The project was designed by Jonathan Wang who was influenced by his musical interests growing up. Seeking to introduce newcomers to music, he sought an opportunity to provide them with a platform that would allow anyone to sample new instruments or practice in private studios.  

<h3>Description</h3>  
Instrument Exchange is an online platform designed to enable instrument and studio owners to list their equipment and space for rental or sale. Users can sign up on the website and browse instruments and studios nearby for lease or sale as well as list their own equipment for others to view.  

Instrument Exchange is a project that will focus on primarily two parties:  
Buyers: Consumers who intend to purchase/rent musical equipment and studios  
Sellers: Those who intend to lease/sell musical equipment and studios  
  
We intend to also include filter options for both parties to provide convenience for buyers.  
These features include:    
1. Filtering by instrument/lease duration for the buyer  
2. Filtering by price and location of the seller  
  
If possible, we also intend to integrate a social media platform for the sellers to offer them the opportunity to connect with others interested in musical performances. We will pursue this if there is enough time to do so.  
  
We intend to complete this project using JavaScript with the framework React.  
The project will be developed as a website and utilize PayPal as a means to exchange money.
