<h2>Project Details</h2>  
Instrument Exchange is a project that will focus on primarily two parties:  
Buyers: Consumers who intend to purchase/rent musical equipment and studios  
Sellers: Those who intend to lease/sell musical equipment and studios  
  
We intend to also include filter options for both parties to provide convenience for buyers.  
These features include:    
1. Filtering by instrument/lease duration for the buyer  
2. Filtering by price and location of the seller  
  
If possible, we also intend to integrate a social media platform for the sellers to offer them the opportunity to connect with others interested in musical performances. We will pursue this if there is enough time to do so.  
  
We intend to complete this project using JavaScript with the framwork React.  
The project will be developed as a website and utilize PayPal as a means to exchange money.
