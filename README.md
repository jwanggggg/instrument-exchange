<h3>History</h3>  
The project was designed by Jonathan Wang who was influenced by his musical interests growing up. Seeking to introduce newcomers to music, he sought an opportunity to provide them with a platform that would allow anyone to sample new instruments or practice in private studios.  

<h3>Description</h3>  
Instrument Exchange is an online platform designed to enable instrument and studio owners to list their equipment and space for rental or sale. This platform enables aspiring musicians to trial new instruments from other instrument owners. The interface will be very similar to Ebay or Craigslist where consumers are able to browse on an easily navigable interface where they are able to filter by a number of attributes including location, price, instrument, user rating, and condition of instrument. Users can sign up on the website and browse instruments and studios in their local area for lease or sale as well as list their own equipment for others to view. In signing up, all users will have dual ability to list their own instruments as well as purchase from others. Furthermore, the product will possibly aspire to implement a function to introduce a social media like platform that enables others to seek performances in listing their expertise, as well as list music lessons that others would be able to purchase.   
  
<h3>Technologies</h3>  
The project will utilize JavaScript/React as a frontend framework to allow users to easily navigate the platform. In addition, the unit testing framework Mocha will be used to complement our use of JavaScript.   
MongoDB will be used as a database platform to maintain users' data and transaction history to record all products listed and purchased as well as user profile information such as login and password.  
The authentication software used to ensure security will be Passport.js. A file system will be used to maintain all photos listed by sellers.  
Monetary transactions through our platform will be securely done through implementing PayPal.
